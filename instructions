1. Add the dataset folder in data_TP directory
2. dataset folder should include "train", "test", "copaal_output" and "factcheck_output" and embeddings folders.
3. all files should be in respective folder. test and train folder should contain test and train files without any extension (.nt/.txt).


3. Generate sentence embeddings by running overall_process/generate_sentence_embeddings_from_FactCheck_output.py file
4. Generate copaal veracity scores output file by running overall_process/generate_veracity_scores_file_from_copaal_output.py file
5. To sort and exclude missing triples/embeddings/veracity_scores/factcheck results you should run overall_process/sort_and_exculde_incomplete_triples.py.
After runnning it unzip the file which is generated.

5. To generate embeddings, feel free to use utils/getEmbeddingsFromAPIcall.py class.
You may want to modify the service that you want to use or generate embeddings and which dataset you want to use add in list.
If some entity or relation embeddings are missing, then you need to delete the respective triples from the file. (check missing.txt file)
if some entity or relation embeddings are missing, you should run overall_process/sort_and_exculde_incomplete_triples.py again.
